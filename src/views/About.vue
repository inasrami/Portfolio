                The Beginning
            </h3>
            <p class="text-md font-extralight text-center text-md">
                I first started learning coding even before beginning my university studies in architecture. 
                Although I paused my programming journey for about two years during that time,
                 I returned to it with full dedication a year ago—and I haven't looked back since.

            <h3 class="text-blue-300 mb-2  font-semibold">
                Technical Expertise
            </h3>
            <p class="text-md font-extralight text-center">
                I'm confident with HTML and CSS, and I'm currently building a strong foundation in JavaScript through a fundamentals course.
                 I also have basic knowledge of Python and Java, supported by completed introductory courses. In addition,
                  I've worked with Vue.js and Tailwind CSS, and I'm planning to start learning React to expand my frontend toolkit.

            <h3 class="text-blue-300 mb-2  font-semibold">
                Project Experience
            </h3>
            <p class="text-md font-extralight text-center">
                Along the way, I had the opportunity to collaborate with a friend to build a platform, 
                which I'm excited to showcase in the Projects section of my portfolio. 
                This experience helped me develop not just technical skills, but also teamwork and project planning.

                Creative Background
            </h3>
            <p class="text-md font-extralight text-center">
                Outside of coding, I've been working as a freelance photographer, photo editor, 
                and graphic designer since 2019—a creative passion that began for me back in 2012. 
                This creative side helps me bring a strong sense of design, detail, and visual storytelling into my web projects.

            </h3>
            <p class="text-md font-extralight text-center">
                My current goal is to grow as a skilled frontend developer, with a long-term ambition of becoming a fullstack developer.
                I'm passionate about learning, creating, and continuously improving, and I'm excited for the journey ahead.
